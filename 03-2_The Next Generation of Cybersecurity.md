### What is Zero Trust?
##### ZTA moves away from the perimeter approach and instead assumes, as the name would suggest, zero trust in the network itself.
##### By assuming that the network is compromised, security can take a more nuanced approach by guarding access to the resources within the network and building strong authentication and authorization standards to allow specific access based on user- and device-specific attributes.
##### ZTA operates on a “least-privilege access” model by only granting users and devices access to the applications, services and data that are absolutely necessary for their role within an organization.
##### By using “role” as a centerpiece for determining access, an organization can share its resources and data with more precision, and quickly expand or limit a user’s access as he or she takes on different roles.

##### Perimeter security will continue to serve as the first line of defense, but blind reliance on it will increase the risk of network breach and data interception.
##### ZTA can gap-fill for perimeter security by catching network breachers at the next layer of access, matching the identity of users and devices to authorizations associated with those users and devices to ensure access is granted appropriately and securely.
##### ZTA shifts the emphasis from the perimeter of a network to the discrete applications and services within a network, building more specific access controls to those specific resources.
##### This method of wrapping security around applications and services is known as “microsegmentation,” and it allows for more targeted security and management of access beyond traditional perimeter security.
