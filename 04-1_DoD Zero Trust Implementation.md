# DoD Zero Trust Implementation:
### DoD is Ready for Implementation
##### Many DoD network systems are old and siloed, but as noted above, that does not mean that they are limited from implementing zero trust.
##### Zero trust solutions can start within a single organization or cross-organizational application, and rapidly drive all users and devices that interface with that organization or application to come into compliance and register their attributes for authentication and authorization.
##### ZTA can be implemented across DoD by building on an initial set of applications and services that adhere to zero trust principles, creating an ever-expanding web of users and devices that have their characteristics mapped for access management.
##### Both organization-specific applications and cross-organizational applications are valid starting points for zero trust
##### - as long as they have a broad number of touchpoints with users and devices, the basics of zero trust will spread across DoD.
##### DoD operations increasingly require better information flow between users and devices in and out of DoD, and ZTA can provide a solution for that need.
##### DoD employees, contractors, third party subject matter experts and allied forces could more easily access and share informationusing ZTA authentication and authorization rules to grant highly specific access without risking exposure of the rest of the network.
##### DoD may already have the groundwork for an identification system to support the authentication process, in the form of the CAC card. 
##### The basic characteristics housed on a CAC can serve as a foundation for compliance, with the option of adding more nuanced characteristics over time.
##### By leveraging existing identity management mechanisms like the CAC to shift to ZTA, DoD will enable improved data sharing and increase situational awareness while better defending against threats.
##### Due to the large number of siloed networks across DoD, any shift to ZTA would likely have to be incremental, starting with a standard set of identity checks for applications and services that could gradually be integrated into common mechanisms for authentication and authorization across DoD.
##### As part of this effort, DoD will need to improve its digital management and tracking of user roles (and changes to those roles) across the organization in order to build access control for specific applications and services.
##### While some of this effort will require security architecture reconfiguration, there will also need to be a shift in the security culture throughout DoD to promote accurate and consistent record-keeping of roles and other identity characteristics.
