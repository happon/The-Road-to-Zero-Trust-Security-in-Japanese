# Cybersecurity Current State: Perimeter Security 

The rapid evolution and expansion of the digital world has come with a growing number of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.  

But despite these developments, cybersecurity practices have only made modest improvements over the past few decades.  

Early users relied on anti-virus scanning to detect and remove viruses from individual devices, and these practices ultimately evolved to include endpoint protection, threat detection, and response to defend the broader network.  

These early networks had a limited number of end points and users and subsequently could rely on “perimeter” security, which emphasizes guarding the entry/exit points to the network by checking the user’s identity and the data packets that come in and out.  

However, this approach rapidly becomes strained as networks expand to include a vast number of endpoints, with users requiring access from various locations.  

Additionally, adversaries continue to find creative methods of getting around perimeter security, such as social engineering attacks that manipulate users into giving away their credentials.  

This network expansion and adversary creativity requires increasing numbers of firewalls with complex inspection specifications, which is cost-intensive with diminishing returns.  

Perimeter security rapidly devolves into a game of “whack-a-mole,” where firewalls must constantly be adjusted to account for an expanding set of authorized entrants into the network and acceptable traffic in and out of the network.  

These firewalls will frequently duplicate efforts, creating burdensome and costly infrastructure that is largely ineffective.  


DoD networks face this strain, but on a larger scale and with higher stakes than private sector.  

As the battlefield continues to rapidly evolve and adversaries close the capability gap with DoD, DoD will require elevated situational awareness to enhance decision-making, and this will require massive data sharing in real time across a wide, diverse set of systems and platforms.  

Various technology advancements will increase DoD capabilities in this direction: for example, the shift from 4G to 5G will drastically impact the future of global communication networks and fundamentally change the environment in which DoD operates.  

5G will enable a higher volume of data shared between more systems and platforms at a faster rate, and has the ability to enhance DoD decision-making and strategic capabilities, from the enterprise network to the tactical edge of the battlefield.  

5G will increase DoD’s ability to link multiple systems into a broader network while sharing information in real time, improving communication across Services, geographies, and domains while developing a common picture of the battlefield to improve situational awareness.  


This rapid data transfer is critical to the development of future DoD capabilities and enhanced situational awareness.  

Artificial intelligence and machine learning applied to DoD systems will depend on that flow of data, which will in turn enable a host of new technologies and missions, from resilient satellite constellations to mesh networks.  

However, each of the added endpoints and data transfers within this expanded network creates a new opportunity for adversaries to target data and operational capability on DoD networks.  

As the attack surface expands, perimeter security will increasingly becoming overwhelmed, allowing more unauthorized users to slip into the network.  

Just as these technologies generate more data traffic, they will also enable the volume and speed of threats to increase, making it difficult for any perimeter security system to monitor and manage those threats.  

Without a change in cybersecurity strategy, DoD runs the risk of compromising its data, networks and operations.
