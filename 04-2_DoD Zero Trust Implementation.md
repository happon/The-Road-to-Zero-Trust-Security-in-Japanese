### Questions to Ask When Implementing
##### Zero Trust Implementing ZTA involves a gradual shift across the entire network, services, and computing devices space.
##### Implementation is a journey that can result in a successively more secure organization with each additional step taken.
##### Below are a set of questions you can ask to see if your organization is effectively implementing ZTA.
##### 1. In a world where the network boundary cannot be trusted, encryption of data in transit and at rest is critical. 
##### Does your organization have a plan to ensure that 100% of data transmitted between devices and stored on mass storage is securely encrypted?
##### Does the organization have a robust and secure encryption key management strategy? 
##### 2. Many recent cybersecurity exploits leverage the vulnerability of the network boundary to access incompletely secured systems accessible in the network.
##### It is critical to ensure that piercing the network perimeter does not enable network access.
##### Is your organization aggressively searching for and reducing traditional inside-thenetwork vulnerabilities, such as data stored in unsecured locations, excessive use of service accounts, and standing administration privileges?
##### 3. ZTA requires verification of the true identity of the user and device accessing a system.
##### Is your organization enforcing Multi-factor Authentication on 100% of the services and servers available to users on all end user, devices including mobile devices?
##### 4. Strong ZTA requires verification that only healthy devices can access an organization’s computing resources. Does your organization have processes in place to continuously scan all end user devices for malicious software, and is device health a real time criterion for accessing your organization’s services?
