# The Next Generation of Cybersecurity: Zero Trust
### Shift from Perimeter to Zero Trust
##### Compare the experience of living in a house versus living in an apartment building.
##### In your house, there are only a handful of entrances and a handful of familiar people with keys to those entrances.
##### For these reasons, you probably don’t lock all the doors inside your house because you have faith in the “perimeter security” (in this case, locked doors leading to the outside with a select list of people with access).
##### In an apartment building, there are many more points of entry and a longer list of people with access, which decreases your familiarity with other access holders and increases the risk of unauthorized access.
##### For this reason, you likely lock the door to your apartment instead of just relying on the perimeter security of the apartment building, because you have less certainty that every person in the building has authorization to be there.
##### Early networks may have looked like houses, but they are increasingly moving in the direction of apartment buildings, with constant internal traffic offering potential access to each unit. Networks have become widely dispersed across a complex web of connections to outside servers and other networks, with larger numbers of “tenants” and a growing number of entry/exit points.
##### As noted earlier, perimeter security has become increasingly expensive as it requires more firewalls with complex filtering capabilities to cover the expanding attack surface of a network, all while the security of the network continues to decrease as regular usage creates new vulnerabilities.
##### For this reason, it is useful to assume that the network is compromised and take a more targeted approach to security.
